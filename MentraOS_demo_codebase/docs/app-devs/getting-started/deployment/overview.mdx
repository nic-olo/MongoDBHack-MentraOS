Now that you've made a MentraOS app, it's time to deploy. A MentraOS app is just a regular web app, so you can deploy it anywhere. We recommend using **[Railway](/app-devs/getting-started/deployment/railway-deployment)** for deployment. You can also deploy on an Ubuntu cloud server.

## Local Development

Testing locally? See our [Local Development](/app-devs/getting-started/deployment/local-development) guide to learn how to use ngrok to expose your local server to MentraOS Cloud.

## Deployment Options

Choose your preferred deployment method:

- **[Local Development](/app-devs/getting-started/deployment/local-development)** - Test locally with ngrok tunneling
- **[Railway Deployment](/app-devs/getting-started/deployment/railway-deployment)** - Quick and easy deployment with automatic scaling
- **[Ubuntu Server Deployment](/app-devs/getting-started/deployment/ubuntu-deployment)** - Self-hosted deployment on an Ubuntu cloud server
